## Crystal Warriors (2020)
##### Read this for: how I write dialogue, scene description and character relationships, some extremely scandalous puns and innuendos.

**Content Warning:** *explicit sexual references, jokes and descriptions.*

Written for Mindgeek’s gaming division (Nutaku) this is the scenario text for one of their first entirely in-house productions, a mobile RTS called Crystal Warriors. I was tasked with writing the scenario, dialogue, and tutorials, as well as the more explicit CG scenes. The central hook of the game was recruiting and training a harem of characters modeled after male adult film stars. The tone was meant to be humorous and light-hearted while also consistent with classical fantasy tropes.

A considerable but productive constraint on this project was that the game was going to be an asset swap of an existing game, meaning the scenario had to follow the existing arc of the base game and that the new characters would have dialogue at the same point as their analogs. This created interesting but not insurmountable challenges as I found ways to write conversations around “who’s-speaking-when” rather than “who’s-speaking-why”.  This is the reason the characters in this script retain the names of their female counterparts in the original game.

**Rose:** I loved working on this project. Coming up with quick tastes of unique characters was a really enjoyable exercise and plotting a slowly growing tenderness between the central triad was a surprisngly sweet experience.

**Thorn:** I regret that there wasn't better communication within the organization around what the goals, methods or status of this project was. I really would have liked to see it made into something more than a script, and I think it would have been a great prestige piece for the company.

**Seed**: Given the opportunity to do it again, I'd be more proactive about connecting with the people working on the project beyond my immediate team. It was one of the first times that Nutaku and the Paysites Creative team had collaborated, and there was still ambiguity around what our relationship with each other should be.
