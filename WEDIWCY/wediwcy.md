## WORK! Everybody does it, why can't you? (2018)
##### Read this for: an idea of how I write satire, how I mix sincerity and humour, how I explore a character's worldview, an idea of how job-searching might look to an NPC in a FromSoftware game.

A six-part series of career advice for job-seekers commissioned by the late Brunch Club Comedy Blog, a blog run by an independent comedy production company. Emphasizes the importance of authenticity, being one's self, understanding one's self as something only temporarily granted by a high and unknowable authority, ignoring pro-canine propaganda, and most importantly being true to one's heart. Tonally, one should consider the tongue not just in the cheek but having started a settlement in the cheek and founded a bizarre arcane religion there.

**Rose**: This was a really gratifying project to work on. I was given a long leash to write whatever I wanted, and the sense of being trusted by the editors of the blog was very empowering even if the stakes weren't especially high. It was very creatively invigorating and stirred a strong desire to build an entire world around the strange, broken narrator of the pieces, but sadly there were bills to pay!

**Thorn**: Something I regret about this project is that I didn't have the resources to do quite as much multi-media trickery and hijinks as I would have liked to. I initially envisioned video components, audiolog-style guided meditations and (believe it or not) a painted comic portion. I knew that I wouldn't be able to execute at the level of quality that I wanted to with the time and resources that I had available though, so much of the vision was scaled back.

**Seed**: Given the opportunity to do it again, I'd like to have come at it more holistically instead of writing it on a per-post basis. The serialized format did produce some productive contraints, but I wonder how it might have gone differently had I a cleared vision of what I wanted the whole of it to look like.
