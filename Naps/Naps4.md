# Sleeper's Colloquy

|Description| Nap name|
------------|----------
|When your mom leaves the table during Thanksgiving dinner and proceeds to nap on the nearest couch, only to wake up in time for dessert|The Pheasant Hunter’s Second Wind|
|Midnight pre-rave nap?|Courting the Kiss of Sweet Fortuna|
|When you eat an edible and pass out in your office chair|A Rolling Idyll on the Green|
|Best nap for me is when you nap and wake up with your cats looking at you|Receiving the Blessing of Bastet|
|Sweat nap|Returning from the Siren’s Grotto|
|What about when I fall instantly into a super deep sleep and wake up the next day with my neck bent at a terrible angle lying on top of a completely dead arm and then I think I’ve killed my arm and have to hang it over the side of my bed in fear until the blood comes back|Tangling with the Night Wyrm|
|What about when you sleep for 3 days?|The Long Wet Kiss|
|Nap wrapped in a dog hair covered towel reddened like a lobster from a bath that’s too hot that I just got out of. Over the covers|Visiting Cerberus at the Gates|
|What’s the nap where you sit down on your bed mid-afternoon planning on innocently scrolling through Instagram for a few minutes and then suddenly you wake up and it’s pitch dark outside and in your room and you’re not sure what time it is, where or who you are|Rocking Narcissus’ Cradle|
|Sleeping face down into my pillow sprawled like a starfish|The Kraken’s Recline|
|GHB induced bathhouse nap|The Sodomite’s Trance|
|Napping in the tub|Playing Marathe|
