## Sleeper's Colloquy (2019)
##### Read this for: a sense of my ability to iterate on a theme, inject humor and whimsy into *tired* subject matter, and generally playful approach to creativity.

Let's call it an experiment in collaborative world-building. I solicited my friends and followers on Instagram to send me descriptions of types of naps, and told them I would tell them the True Name of that nap in exchange. What resulted was an extremely fun exercise in quickly, and repeatedly improvising in writing (two fields that I'd enjoyed apart but hadn't thought about trying in combination, very Reese's Peanut Butter Cups).

**Rose:** A real thrill and a fond memory of sharing my writing with my friends in a way that didn't feel quite so pompous as a reading or high-pressure as a stand-up performance. A great reminded that social media can be a tool for fun(!!) sometimes.
<br>

**Thorn:** The experimental nature of generating the naps, accepting descriptions from anyone who wanted to submit one, means theres sometimes a bleakness or sadness that can be hard to square with the jokeyness of the project. Perhaps a compelling contrast thought! 
<br>

**Seed**: I would love to make something more of this project than a table or an instagram slideshow. I've toyed with the idea of making a zine or chapbook, but wonder if I've waited too long for it to feel worthwhile.
