**Rose:** As always, I have a blast exploring the sad little corners of someone trying to hold it together. Someone who thinks they're maintaining but simply are not. These were all very fun to perform.

**Thorn:** As monologues the characters don't get to bounce off other personalities enough for my liking. A reminder of the positive friction of character and conflict.

**Seed**: What does it look like when these characters have to speak to one another? I want to see more of their worlds.
